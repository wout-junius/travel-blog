## From Palermo to Tirano: A journey crossing Italy by rail

### Introduction

Our adventure continued as we left our hotel bright and early, around 7 o'clock, ready for a brisk half-hour walk to the Messina train station. Our destination? The capital of Sicily, Palermo, on the opposite side of this stunning Italian island. Little did we know that this leg of our journey would offer some of the most breathtaking views and thrilling moments of our entire trip for now.

### Scenic Train Ride Across Sicily

The train route from Messina to Palermo proved to be nothing short of amazing. The tracks hugged the coastline, affording us magnificent vistas of coastal towns, pristine beaches, and dramatic cliffs. The journey was far from dull, with each passing moment revealing a new spectacle. It may have been a lengthy ride, but with a captivating podcast to listen to and views like these, the time flew by as if it were mere minutes.

### A Pit Stop in Palermo

Upon our arrival in Palermo, we secured our bags in a safe place, as we had some time to spare before our eagerly awaited night train to Milan. A quick lunch and a visit to a grocery store were on the agenda since the night train only included breakfast and did not serve warm meals.

However, a moment of panic ensued when we returned to retrieve our luggage only to find the place closed with a "Be right back" sign. Our night train was poised for boarding on its platform, and we had no idea when the luggage storage would reopen.

After inquiring with station staff, we eventually located the attendant who returned our bags. We boarded the train just in the nick of time.

### A Night Train Surprise

Finally, we were on board the long-awaited night train set to traverse Italy. Our cabin was fantastic, with just the two of us. However, a twist awaited us as the conductor requested that we switch rooms due to a bed assignment error. To our astonishment, the new room came with its own bathroom and shower—an unexpected upgrade.

We retraced our journey through Sicily, enjoying the spectacular views. But the highlight was yet to come—the train on a ferry! The conductor advised us to head to the front for the best view. It was a mesmerizing experience watching the train being loaded onto the boat. Once on board the ferry, we ventured out on deck, soaking in the breathtaking views and the refreshing breeze. We took numerous photos and relished the experience. This unique train-on-a-boat journey is a memory we'll cherish forever.

### A Restless Night and an Unexpected Wake-Up Call

As night fell, we departed for Milan. Unfortunately, it wasn't all smooth sailing. The bed felt cramped for a tall person like me, and the combination of loud noises and an uncomfortable driving style made sleeping a challenge.

Morning brought an unexpected interruption. A knock on the door signaled the conductor with breakfast. We hadn't been prepared, nor did we have the chance to choose our breakfast items, as the service had promised. Breakfast was light and not to our liking, and the beds remained unconverted to seats, making our Milan arrival less than pleasant.

### Milan's Bustling Arrival

Upon reaching Milan, we were greeted by a bustling station, and its sheer size was overwhelming. Our hopes of using the luggage storage service were dashed when we encountered a long line. We had no choice but to leave our bags there, hoping to retrieve them later in the day on time for our train.

### Exploring Milan

With limited time in Milan, we navigated the metro's maze to reach the city center. There, we marveled at the cathedral and explored nearby attractions. We indulged in local cuisine before returning to the station. During our return, we managed to squeeze in some souvenir shopping to commemorate our journey.

### The Journey Continues: Tirano and the Bernina Line

Our next train ride was a scenic delight, featuring stunning mountain and lake views. It was the perfect prelude to the next leg of our adventure—the renowned Bernina Line, which would take us through some of the most stunning mountains of Switzerland.

Stay tuned as we traverse the picturesque landscapes of Switzerland and continue our journey through Europe, one breathtaking moment at a time.
