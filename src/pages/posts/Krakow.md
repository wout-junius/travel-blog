## From Berlin to Kraków: A Train Journey Through Europe

### Introduction

As we bid farewell to Hamburg, our next adventure beckoned—a journey to the historic city of Krakow, Poland. Our chosen mode of transport was the Deutsche Bahn, which promised a comfortable ride aboard the ICE 1 train to Berlin and a seamless transfer to the Euro City train bound for Krakow. Little did we know that this leg of our journey would bring its own set of surprises and delights.

### The ICE 1 Experience

Our journey kicked off smoothly with an early morning departure from Hamburg Altona to Berlin. Initially, it seemed that all first-class seats were booked, but a stroke of luck led us to an unreserved compartment that only had reservations from Berlin onwards. The ICE 1 provided a comfortable ride, and we were pleasantly surprised when it arrived in Berlin with just a few minutes of delay—a rare feat for Deutsche Bahn.

### Berlin Hbf: A Grand Interlude

With an hour to spare in Berlin, we took the opportunity to explore the magnificent Berlin Hauptbahnhof (Berlin Hbf) station. Its grand architecture and bustling atmosphere offered a glimpse into the heart of the city.

### Onward to Kraków

Our journey to Krakow continued with a last-minute platform change, a minor inconvenience considering it was just a short walk away. We boarded the Euro City train, securing seats in first class. However, the limited seat selection options in European trains meant that we were sitting not facing each other. Nevertheless, the ample legroom more than made up for it.

### The Train Dining Experience

As our journey meandered through the Polish countryside, we decided to savor a meal in the onboard restaurant. The experience was unique, featuring table service and a picturesque view outside our windows. The food, while not gourmet, was satisfying, and the ever-changing landscape, filled with old factories and mining operations, made for a captivating dining backdrop.

### A Delayed But Untroubled Arrival

As we progressed, we realized we had accumulated an hour of delay. Fortunately, this didn't cause us much concern, as our apartment hotel check-in time allowed for flexibility.

### Kraków Exploration

Our first night in Kraków led us to a charming local restaurant, where friendly service and an English menu made us feel at home. The following day, despite heavy rain, we ventured out to discover the city. To escape the downpour, we explored the engaging Technical and Engineering Museum of Kraków, complete with informative English explanations and a collection of historic trams.

When the rain subsided, we ventured to Kraków's Old Town, where picturesque buildings, city walls, ancient churches, monasteries, and the exquisite old University greeted us. Though our time in Kraków was brief, the city left a lasting impression.

### Next Stop: Budapest

With Kraków's beauty etched in our memories, our next destination awaited—Budapest, Hungary. Join us as we continue our European adventure, ready to explore the rich culture and history that Hungary's capital has to offer.
