## From Budapest to Sicily: A Journey Filled with Surprises Continues

### Introduction

Our journey continued from Budapest, filled with excitement for our next destination, Sicily. However, as we were about to discover, how unique the twists and turns of his leg of our adventure would be, making it all the more memorable.

### A Soviet Elevator Adventure

It all began in the early hours of the morning as we left our Budapest hostel, aiming to catch our train to Innsbruck, with a transfer in mind that would take us to Bologna. Little did we know that the day's adventures would start with a dramatic twistâ€”getting stuck in an old Soviet-era elevator. Panic set in as thoughts raced through our minds: Would we make it to our train on time? Would we get out quickly?

Rescue arrived after we rang the alarm and got in touch with the elevator company, and we were immensely relieved that they spoke English. Within 20 minutes, we were freed from our confined space, and we rushed to catch a trolleybus that would take us to the station.

### A Race Against Time

Arriving at the station, we found that we still had enough time to make it for our train, allowing us to enjoy a pleasant breakfast in the Business lounge of the MaV. Our first-class Interrail passes granted us access to this luxurious space.

With just five minutes to spare before the train's departure, we dashed to our wagon. Onboard, we approached a train driver and managed, despite the language barrier, to visit the cab. He proudly shared stories of pulling a train loaded whit Mercedes the previous night and recommended a nearby train restaurant near Budapest Keleti.

### Business Class Luxuries

After this delightful conversation, we took our seats in Business Class, having paid a 15-euro upgrade on top of our Interrail passes. It was worth every penny as we enjoyed ultra-deluxe chairs with ample legroom, a complimentary welcome drink, and onboard service. It was a luxurious experience that added a touch of indulgence to our journey.

### The Journey to Bologna

As we traveled from Innsbruck to Bologna, our route took us through the picturesque Brenner Pass into Italy. The breathtaking views of valleys, rivers, and towering mountains painted a stunning picture of the journey.

Arriving in Bologna, we ventured into a local pizzeria, far from the tourist crowds, and fully immersed in an authentic Italian atmosphere. We savored delicious dishes, including a Prosciutto pizza, fresh Coca-Cola from the tap, and a delightful flan dessert, concluding the meal with a shot of Limoncello.

### A New Day and a New Train

The next morning, well-rested from our comfortable hotel stay, we left around 9:30 to catch our train. This time, we boarded the Frecciarossa, enjoying the luxury of Business Class seating. The welcome package included snacks, sandwiches, and drinks, although we found ourselves longing for working Wi-Fi.

Our journey proceeded with a slight delay, but as we sped past Florence, Rome, and Naples, our optimism waned. The southern leg of our journey turned chaotic in Naples, where we encountered unexpected delays and challenges. It was a testament to the unpredictability of travel, reminding us that even in the face of setbacks, the adventure continues.

### A Rainy Challenge in Messina

In Naples, our delay grew by an hour, and it stretched closer to two hours by the time we reached the coastal town of Villa San Giovanni. However, our journey took an intriguing turn here. To cross the Strait of Messina, we boarded a perfectly timed ferry to Messina, where our hotel awaited us.

Getting from the ferry terminal to our hotel became a challenge due to an unexpected heavy rainstorm. Chaos reigned as we scrambled to find a bus amidst the downpour. The rain was relentless, but we remained undeterred in our quest to reach our destination.
