## From Kraków to Budapest: A Journey Filled with Surprises

### Introduction

Embarking on yet another adventure, we found ourselves filled with anticipation as we prepared to leave Kraków for the enchanting city of Budapest. This time, our schedule allowed for a bit more rest, as our Euro City train was set to depart from Kraków Główny station at the leisurely hour of 10:40 AM. Unbeknownst to us this leg of our journey would be marked by unexpected twists and newfound friendships.

### Delayed Departure

Our journey began with a delightful breakfast at the train station, where we discovered that our train was running about 15 minutes late. However, as it was a direct train with no connections to make, we remained unruffled. When the train finally arrived, we noticed that it consisted of compartments. The sight of a growing crowd at our compartment was a bit intimidating, as we wondered how crowded it would be.

### The Unexpected Compartment

To our surprise, the compartment turned out to be not the usual 6-seat arrangement but a cramped 8-person setup. The prospect of an 8+ hour journey in such close quarters was less than promising. As we settled in, we faced the puzzle of fitting everyone's luggage into the limited storage space. Fortunately, my affinity for Tetris came in handy, and I managed to arrange the luggage to fit perfectly.

### An Unplanned Transfer

Shortly after departure, a ticket check revealed that this was not our intended train. The correct carriages were waiting for us at the next station, Katowice. The transfer to more comfortable seats in an open wagon with only four seats proved to be a welcome change. Sharing the journey with fellow passengers bound for the same destination for over eight hours forged a camaraderie that made conversations easy and enjoyable.

### A Railway Maneuver in Bohuim

Our journey continued with some delays, but the most intriguing part occurred in Bohuim. Two trains, each coming from different parts of Poland with sections bound for Budapest and Prague, converged at this station. They disconnected and reconnected the sections, all while passengers remained in their seats—a fascinating sight!

### Arrival in Beautiful Budapest

After more time and additional delays, we finally arrived in the stunning city of Budapest. Our hostel was conveniently just a 10-minute walk from the station. On our first evening, we dined behind our hostel and took a leisurely evening stroll, passing by the Basilica and the Budapest Opera, before ending up by the Danube River for a breathtaking view of the Buda side of the city.

### Exploring Budapest's Charms

The next morning, our exploration began with a ride on the oldest subway in mainland Europe, taking us to its terminus where we enjoyed breakfast in a charming café. As we emerged from the subway station, we were greeted by a light rain shower, but it soon gave way to a brilliant blue sky, setting the stage for a perfect day of adventure.

We then returned to the Danube, taking tram line 2, renowned as one of the most beautiful tram routes in the world. It afforded us splendid views of the Buda Castle and the majestic Parliament building, all while riding in a classic Budapest tram.

We ventured to Buda Castle, though some of it was under construction due to a film shoot about the French Revolution, directed by Johnny Depp. We were fortunate enough to catch a glimpse of Depp leaving the set in a black SUV. Our exploration also led us through the picturesque town surrounding the castle, and we captured a quick picture of the Basilica in daylight.

### A Night at Budapest Keleti Station

Later, we explored Budapest Keleti station and observed the fascinating activity in the rail yards, where the night train to Bucharest was being prepared for its evening departure.

### Conclusion

As we concluded our exploration of Budapest, we couldn't help but look forward to the next part of our journey—a journey that would bring its own set of challenges and surprises. Stay tuned for the next post, where we share our adventures and luxurious of traveling Business class on our way to Bologne!
